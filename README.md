AC: New Murder is a murder-mystery who-dun-it in the style of Phoenix Wright, featuring characters from Animal Crossing. The story and art are done by my sister Jenn. I developed the game for web browsers and built out all things software related. Oh, and I wrote the music!

Each character in the game has a pretty distinct theme and personality, with music to match! All of the music is original - but definitely inspired by other games. Video game music has been a big inspiration in my own writing, so it was a blast writing music for one! (Not to mention PRETTY WILD to develop a full on game!)
